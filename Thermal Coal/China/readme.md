In 2022, the market theoretically recorded a Surplus of 0.79 million tonnes. However, contradicting this signal, the Price Benchmark surged to a record high of 1240 RMB per tonne.
Turning to the drivers, we can see that internal pressure is extreme high with the capacity utilizatioin hitting 102,27%. In the mean while, the external support faltered in 2022 as the thermal coal imports contracted from 2,66 to 2,26 tonnes.
Therefore, a structural mismatch occurred. While supply was sufficient in the Northwest where the coal is producted, logistics bottlenecks prevented it from reaching the Southeast where the electricity is produced. Combined with a drop in imports, this caused a shortage of effective supply at power plants, driving prices up despite the theoretical surplus.
Consequently, no elasticity left in the supply chain forces the price to detach from the fundamental surplus and skyrocket to unprecedented levels.								
Despite a growth in supply, the market is facing a persistent Market Deficit in 2024-2025. With Capacity Utilization remaining above 100%, the price benchmark is expected to be supported at 900 RMB per tonne.									

Despite the Price Benchmark soaring to a record high of 1240 RMB/tonne in 2022, demand from the Power Sector surprisingly increased by 3.84%.

This phenomenon highlights the sector’s extreme rigid and low price sensitivity. Unlike other industries, power generation is an essential public utility. 
Therefore, power plants are forced to prioritize energy security over cost control, maintaining purchases even when prices are exorbitant.

Production capacity has plateaued, while demand remains robust.

In the short term (2022): Despite a surplus, prices escalated sharply due to capacity constraints and import disruptions.
In the medium term (2024): This period marks a strategic pivot, as the primary driver shifts from 'power supply assurance' to 'industrial recovery.
In the long term (2025-2030): The sector enters a mature 'zero-growth' phase, enabling industry leaders to secure stable cash flows.
